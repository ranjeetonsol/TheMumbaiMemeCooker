He cooked up meme coins like "Bollywood Bucks" and "Pav Bhaji Token," convinced he was a crypto guru, though often clueless about the market. Despite his ups and downs, Ranjeet's enthusiasm was infectious, with his wild Bollywood-themed pitches entertaining everyone around.

He struck a dramatic pose next to a neon green Lamborghini, as if he were about to launch into a high-energy dance number. "Who knew that memeing and crypto could get you a Lambo?" he exclaimed, flashing a grin as bright as the car’s glossy finish.
